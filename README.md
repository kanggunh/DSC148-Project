# Police Call Prediction Based on Weather

This project analyzes the relationship between weather conditions and police call volumes using linear regression and gradient boosting techniques.

## Data Introduction

The data used in this project includes police call data obtained from the San Jose CA Open Data Portal and weather data collected from the VisualCrossing Weather Data & API. The police call dataset contains information about individual calls made to the police department, while the weather dataset provides daily weather information.

- Police Call Dataset: [https://data.sanjoseca.gov/dataset/police-calls-for-service/resource/](https://data.sanjoseca.gov/dataset/police-calls-for-service)
- Weather Dataset: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data
